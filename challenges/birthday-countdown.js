/*

  Create a function `daysUntilDate` that accepts a string (with the format `"mm/dd/yyyy"`) and
  returns the number of days (integer) between today and that date. Please use the built in
  Javascript `Date` type in your solution.

  See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date

  Next, create a function `birthdayReminder` that accepts an array of objects, containing a person's
  date of birth (dob), and returns an array of reminder messages (strings).

  ```javascript
  birthdayReminder([
    {
      name: "Jack",
      dob: "10/31/2013"
    },
    {
      name: "Jill",
      dob: "4/01/1975"
    }
  ]);

  //=> [
  //      "Jack's birthday is in 75 days",
  //      "Jill's birthday is in 305 days"
  //    ]
  ```

  Bonuses
  - Will your function still work tomorrow when the date is different? Is it future proofed?
  - To make your output more relevant, can you sort by days remaining (ascending)?

// YOUR CODE HERE

// Create a function daysUntilDate(date) {}

var birthday = new Date('12/03/2017');
var birthdayMilliseconds = birthday.getTime();

// Use var today = date.now to get the current number of milliseconds until today.
var todayMilliseconds = Date.now();

var diffInMilliseconds = birthdayMilliseconds - todayMilliseconds;

var diffInDays = diffInMilliseconds / 86400000 // milliseconds in a day

return diffInDays;
